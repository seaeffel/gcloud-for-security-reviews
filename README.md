# gcloud for security reviews

This repository contains gcloud commands that have been very useful for auditing an organisation's GCP Environment.

Some of the commands took me a while to figure out - particularly those that iterate through all folders and projects in an organization. They may not be the most elegant commands but they work.

I hope it helps you out in understanding how to review GCP configuration as part of a Security Review using gcloud.

I will post any new commands/log filters that I find useful.
